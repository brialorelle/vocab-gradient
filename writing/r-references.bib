	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop a new understanding of children's drawings and to provide ideas for future research in early childhood. Starting from classic theories on child graphical development, we proceed to analyze them and provide our own views on the subject. We will also recount a number of relevant empirical studies that appear to validate our theory. Our belief is that emotion and self-expression through movement play a key role in the development of child art, and that this may be already visible during the scribbling stage of drawing.},

@article{Sasaki2016,
	Abstract = {This study examines children's abilities to identify a color-specific object by associating it with a given color. During the experimental sessions in preschool classrooms, 156 children aged 3--5 years were engaged in a drawing and coloring task. The experiment investigated whether the color of the object drawn by the child was congruent to the color that he/she had previously chosen. The results showed that children older than four years of age used object color knowledge to associate the given color with an object, suggesting that children acquire this ability at the same age that they learn to choose a typical color from a color-specific object. The developmental model of object representations is discussed on the basis of these results.},

@article{Villarroel2017,
	Abstract = {The studies regarding how the comprehension of geometric shapes evolves in childhood are largely based on the assessment of children's responses during the course of tasks linked to the recognition, classification or explanation of prototypes and models. Little attention has been granted to the issue as to what extent the geometric shape turns out to be an expressive tool that young children spontaneously use in their pictorial productions and also, whether or not methodological research approaches aimed at the examination of unprompted usage of geometric shapes in childhood may be useful regarding the study of the development of geometric thinking. This evidence provided by this study is coherent with the assumption that before starting primary education, internal representation of closed curves, quadrilaterals and triangles should have been developed by a significant number of children and, more interestingly, that young children's graphical expressivity appears liaised to their skill to depict two-dimensional geometric shapes.},

This has led the field of language acquisition to posit specialized mechanisms that leverage the few words learned in the initial slow phase for faster vocabulary growth later. Simulations and mathematical analysis demonstrate that specialized cognitive changes are unnecessary. The acceleration in lexical acquisition is a necessary by-product of learning if (i) multiple words are learned in parallel and (ii) words are distributed such that there are few words that can be acquired quickly and many difficult ones.},

	abstract = {The present research studied 3- and 4-month-old infants' ability to acquire two categories simultaneously. A familiarization-novelty preference procedure and geometrical form categories were used in all experiments. In Experiments I and 3, infants were familiarized with either a single form category, two form categories, or a single form category plus a set of forms that did not define a category. The results showed that, despite increased attentional and memorial demands, presentation of an additional form category did not harm the efficiency of categorization (Experiment 1) and changed the representation of the form category information from exemplars to a prototype (Experiment 3). Contrasting form information that was not categorical in structure decreased the infant's ability to recognize new members of the single familiar category (Experiment 1) and hindered the infant's ability to form a categorical representation (Experiment 3). The categorization behavior observed in Experiment 1, as indexed by the generalization of habituation to novel forms from a familiar category, was shown not to be a consequence of the inability to discriminate between individual members from the familiar form category (Experiment 2). The implications of these results for cognitive development are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cross-situational learning has recently gained attention as a plausible candidate for the mechanism that underlies the learning of word-meaning mappings. In a recent study, Blythe and colleagues have studied how many trials are theoretically required to learn a human-sized lexicon using cross-situational learning. They show that the level of referential uncertainty exposed to learners could be relatively large. However, one of the assumptions they made in designing their mathematical model is questionable. Although they rightfully assumed that words are distributed according to Zipf's law, they applied a uniform distribution of meanings. In this article, Zipf's law is also applied to the distribution of meanings, and it is shown that under this condition, cross-situational learning can only be plausible when referential uncertainty is sufficiently small. It is concluded that cross-situational learning is a plausible learning mechanism but needs to be guided by heuristics that aid word learners with reducing referential uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Summary A potentially organizing goal of the brain and cognitive sciences is to accurately explain domains of human intelligence as executable, neurally mechanistic models. Years of research have led to models that capture experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. We here advocate for taking the next step: integrating experimental results from many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when considered together, push mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as vision, language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models. This perspective discusses the advantages and the challenges of this approach and proposes specific steps to achieve this goal in the domain of visual intelligence with the case study of an integrative benchmarking platform called Brain-Score.},

In this paper, the impact of eight factors on the size of the effect for the difference in social attention between these two groups are evaluated: age, non-verbal IQ matching, verbal IQ matching, motion, social content, ecological validity, audio input and attention bids. Results show that individuals with ASD spend less time attending to social stimuli than typically developing (TD) controls, with a mean effect size of 0.55. Social attention in ASD was most impacted when stimuli had a high social content (showed more than one person). This meta-analysis provides an opportunity to survey the eye-tracking research on social attention in ASD and to outline potential future research directions, more specifically research of social attention in the context of stimuli with high social content.},

We systematically explored the ability of multiple ventral visual areas to support a variety of 'category-orthogonal' object properties such as position, size and pose. For complex naturalistic stimuli, we found that the inferior temporal (IT) population encodes all measured category-orthogonal object properties, including those properties often considered to be low-level features (for example, position), more explicitly than earlier ventral stream areas. We also found that the IT population better predicts human performance patterns across properties. A hierarchical neural network model based on simple computational principles generates these same cross-area patterns of information. Taken together, our empirical results support the hypothesis that all behaviorally relevant object properties are extracted in concert up the ventral visual hierarchy, and our computational model explains how that hierarchy might be built.},

To assess the organization of IT, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in alert monkeys to achromatic images (faces, fruit, bodies and places) and colored gratings. IT contained multiple color-biased regions, which were typically ventral to face patches and yoked to them, spaced regularly at four locations predicted by known anatomy. Color and face selectivity increased for more anterior regions, indicative of a broad hierarchical arrangement. Responses to non-face shapes were found across IT, but were stronger outside color-biased regions and face patches, consistent with multiple parallel streams. IT also contained multiple coarse eccentricity maps: face patches overlapped central representations, color-biased regions spanned mid-peripheral representations and place-biased regions overlapped peripheral representations. These results show that IT comprises parallel, multi-stage processing networks subject to one organizing principle.},

	abstract = {Object recognition is the process by which humans organize the visual world into meaningful perceptual units. In this Review, we examine the developmental origins and maturation of object recognition by synthesizing research from developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience and computational modelling. We describe the extent to which infants demonstrate early traces of adult visual competencies within their first year. The rapid development of these competencies is supported by infant-specific biological and experiential constraints, including blurry vision and ‘self-curation’ of object viewpoints that best support learning. We also discuss how the neural mechanisms that support object-recognition abilities in infancy seem to differ from those in adulthood, with less engagement of the ventral visual pathway. We conclude that children’s specific developmental niche shapes early object-recognition abilities and their neural underpinnings.},
